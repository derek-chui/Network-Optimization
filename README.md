# Network-Optimization

Non Orthogonal Multiple Access is a wireless communication technique used in 5G to allow multiple users to share the same time and frequency resources, but with different power levels.

NOMA works best when a strong (close) user is paired with a weak (far) user. So our goal is to makes pairs from a set of users with max total utility.
